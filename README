# TODO: format this 

Test notes: 
- all code tested on
    - Ubuntu 22 
    - ROS2 humble 
    - Python 3.10.12
    - continuum_actuation (released firmware version)

Installation notes 
- dependencies 
    - crtk ([text](https://crtk-robotics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html))
        - separate folder inside main src/ folder, need to submodule 
            - crtk/crtk_python_client (should clone from here: https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/crtk_python_client)
            - crtk/crtk_msgs (should clone from here:  https://github.com/collaborative-robotics/crtk_msgs)
    - PyKDL library 
        - sudo apt install python3-pykdl
    - other python libraries (check out requirements.txt file!)
        - installed inside virtual environment 

Software Usage 
- sourcing
    - source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    - cd cr_dvrk_ws 
    - source install/setup.bash
- funtion calls
    - need to point which functions has user-defined parameters that might be changed! 
- building ROS2 package
    - colcon build --symlink-install 


Dev notes for specific functions ----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes for ctr_state_info.py
- need to add in effects of the PSM joint motions 
- need to robustify the enable + home logic! which state does the PSM have to be?

Notes for enable_ctr_teleop.py
- need to robustify the enable + home logic! which state does the MTMR have to be? 


Notes for tdcr_teleop 
- colcon build tree needs to be in a very specific form! 

- Running list of TODOs (additional good-to-have features):
-  make ROS2 launch files so that users dont have to run individual python files! 
-  modify teleop logic to match a state machine implementation (checkout dvrk_teleoperation file in the dvrk_python package)
    - will have change + unit test enable_ctr_teleop.py and enable_tdcr_teleop.py functions 
-  create associated RVIZ files (that gets launch together?) that visualizes the backbone of the continuum robots 
    - for ctr display point of the workspace?
